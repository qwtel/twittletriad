[Twittle Triad](https://twittletriad.meteor.com/) is a card game based on Final Fantasy XIII's mini game *Triple Triad*.

The game involves two players setting cards on a 3x3 grid. Each card has four *ranks*, one for each direction. When a card gets played it will *capture* (flip) each neighbouring card that has a lower adjacent rank. 

The twist is that your cards are the people you follow on Twitter. Their ranks are based on the number of their followers, friends, favourites and tweets.

[You can play it](https://twittletriad.meteor.com/) by creating a new game and then sending the link to a friend.

The app is built using [Meteor](http://www.meteor.com), HTML5 and CSS3 (mostly transitions and perspective) as well as a preview version of Bootstrap 3. The experience is flawless in Chrome, however there are glitches in other browsers since they do not handle rotateY that well. It's currently not working in Opera.
